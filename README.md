HiHi is a social media web app that is directly inspired by Twitter. Functionally, it enables users to register and login to accounts, follow and unfollow other users, view and like hihis (posts) from other users they are following on their main feed, and to create their own hihis which can be viewed either on their own profiles or the feeds of any user who follows them.

HiHi was developed with a stack of HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SASS, ReactJS, Redux, Node.JS, Express, Authenticare, SQLite, Postgres, Knex.JS.
